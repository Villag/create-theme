# Create Theme

"Create" is a WordPress theme intented to be paired with the ["Create" WordPress plugin](https://github.com/Villag/create-plugin). Together these open source projects power pieces of what can makeup a direcotry of people. These are both active on [createdenton.com](http://createdenton.com).

This theme is meant to be just that -- a theme for the directory. This repository exists to decouple the functionality provided by the "Create" plugin and the style provided here.
